### Project Description:

 The objectives of this project, *Seminole Movie Connection Application using TMDB API*, are building an application using an Application Programming Interface (API); parsing JSON data from an HTTP response message; and using Ajax methods and properties that allow the client to send an HTTP request and receive back an HTTP response from TheMovieDB (TMDB) API to access its movie data.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:

1. The *Background Section* in the project instructions provided that APIs are becoming a crucial part of both the Web and Web development.  What’s more websites are not only readily allowing developers to access their data, but are in fact encouraging it. For example, Google, releases its API to the public so that other software developers can design products that are powered by its service. Websites such as IMDB, OMDb, TMDb, Google, and Twitter allow users to build entirely separate applications based on the data they’ve spent years accumulating.  For example, I am a fan of Turner Classic Movies.  Moreover, per the application built in this project, I was able to retrieve information about the following old movies: Hallelujah, I'm a Bum, released 02-03-1933; The Green Pastures, released 08-01-1936; and Cabin in the Sky, released 04-09-1943 (_Source: Assignment 8 materials._)

2. AJAX technology enables loading data from the server without a browser page refresh--thereby allowing for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML/JSON, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. XHTML is used for content, CSS for presentation, along with the Document Object Model (DOM) and JavaScript for dynamic content display. Applications using AJAX are considered data-driven as opposed to page-driven. For example, the API allows integrating YouTube functionality to a website. It also gives developers access to a search.list method that supports searching of videos, playlists, and channels.

3. The lesson materials explained that a lot of every day services have JSON-based APIs.  Examples provided were Twitter, Facebook, and Flickr which all send back data (HTTP response) in JSON format.There was a host of information provided and interactive exercises made available that support and/or offered guidance on Lesson 8 topics (_Source: Assignment 8 materials._). This was an interesting as well as an involved lesson.  As I remarked in previous README documents, a lot of practice is required for learning a programming language.
